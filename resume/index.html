                <li>Analyzed 100,000+ blog recipes, merging multiple datasets to identify similarities and differences between holiday and non-holiday foods in nutrition and consumption.</li>
                <li>Tested the effect of the holiday season on recipe ratings, hypothesizing that recipes submitted during holidays may be rated more favorably due to seasonal trends and sentiment.</li>
                <li>Built a baseline model that predicted the rating of a recipe based on fat, sugar, calories, and whether it was posted during the holiday season.</li>
                <li>Improved the model by 40% via probabilistic imputation, log-transformation of skewed features, and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
