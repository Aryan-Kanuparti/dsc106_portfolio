                <h3>Recipes and Ratings: Holiday Food Analysis</h3>
                <time>12/2024</time>
            </header>
            <p>-Analyzed 100,000+ blog recipes, merging multiple datasets to identify similarities and differences between holiday and non-holiday foods in the nutrition and consumption of holiday foods. 
                -Tested the effect of the holiday season on recipe ratings, hypothesizing that recipes submitted during holidays may be rated more favorably due to seasonal trends and sentiment.
                -Built a baseline model that predicted the rating of a recipe based on fat, sugar, calories and whether it was posted during the holiday season. 
                -Improved the model by 40% via probabilistic imputation, log-transformation of skewed features, and hyperparameter tuning.</p>

                -Executed OLS regression on normalized demographic data, revealing significant correlations such as a negative relationship between Black or African-American populations and healthcare access (p = 0.021) and a positive correlation with Hispanic populations (p < 0.001).
                -Processed and visualized data from 1,500+ hospitals, using boxplots, t-tests, and geospatial maps to uncover statistically significant differences in care quality between FHA-funded and non-funded hospitals (p = 0.027) and highlight regional disparities, particularly in the East Coast.</p>
